      Movie Website

What is it?
-----------
A dynamic web page allowing viewers to see my favorite movies along with
director, rating, and a poster image.  When a user clicks on the poster image
it will display the movie trailer.


Media.py contains classes for use by fresh_tomatoes.py when generating the
HTML file.

entertainment_center.py contains all the movie data for populating into the
HTML file.

fresh_tomatoes.py contains the HTML and CSS code for the final HTML page.

To run this program, run the entertainment_center.py file using a Python
interpreter.
